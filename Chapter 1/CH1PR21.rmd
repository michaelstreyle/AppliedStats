# This command makes data frame column names available as variables
attach(shipment)

# Plot the data
plot(route,broken)

# Fit the regression model
fit <- lm (broken ~ route)

b0 <- fit$coeff[1]

abline (b0,b1)

broken_2 <- b0 + b1*2

```

The intercept is `r round(b0,2)` GPA units and the slope is `r round(b1,4)` GPA unit per ACT score increment.
